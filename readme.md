# Numworks memory extender revival attempt

This Repo is just me trying to make the Nwagyu Memory Extender Bookmarklet Work again
Making the original Bookmarklet look like this with the modified script source
```javascript:(function()%7B!function()%7Blet%20t%3Ddocument.createElement(%22script%22)%3Bt.type%3D%22text%2Fjavascript%22%2Ct.src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fbenchatondev%2Fnumworksmempatch%2Fmain%2Fnwagra.min.js%22%2Cdocument.head.appendChild(t)%7D()%3B%7D)()%3B```

Sadly Chrome refuses to let the code run because of CORB
